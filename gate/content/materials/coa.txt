COA – Computer Organization & Architecture
This subject is a scoring monster when mastered.
Target: 8–10 marks in GATE CSE — zero guesswork, full domination.


---

🎯 Goal:

Complete mastery of instruction cycles, microprogramming, pipelining, memory hierarchies, and cache
🧠 Understand computer from inside-out like Batman knows every tool in his utility belt.


---

📚 Core Resources

✅ 1. Main Book

📘 Computer Organization – Carl Hamacher (5th Ed)

The gold standard: use for full theory, not exams directly


📘 Computer Organization and Architecture – William Stallings

Excellent for cache, memory hierarchy, virtual memory

Use selectively




---

✅ 2. YouTube Series (GATE Focused)

🎥 Neso Academy – COA Full Playlist (🔥Best for basics & clarity)

🎥 Gate Smashers – COA in Hindi-English (🔥Great for revision)

🎥 Ravindrababu Ravula (RRR) – Advanced level instruction sets and pipelining



---

✅ 3. Practice Resources

🔗 GATE Overflow – PYQs (Last 15 years)

📄 Made Easy Workbook for COA

🔗 GeeksforGeeks & ExamVeda – COA Quizzes

🔗 VisuAlgo – visualize registers, binary logic

💻 Write mini code in assembly-style for bonus confidence
