📘 Primary Sources (Core Concepts + Problem Mastery)

1. Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach – by Kurose & Ross
🔹 Deep understanding with real-world flow
🔹 Follow GATE syllabus-wise (skip lower-level implementation details not in GATE)
⏱ Suggested use: 1–2 chapters/week (refer, not rote-read)


2. NPTEL Course: Computer Networks – Prof. Bhaskar Ramamurthi / IIT Madras
🔹 Gold-standard for GATE-level topics
🔹 Videos + PDF + Assignments
🔗 https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106105183


3. GATE Overflow: CN Notes & Practice (by toppers)
🔹 Includes short notes, mistakes, edge cases
🔗 https://gateoverflow.in/tags/computer-networks

📗 Practice & Question Banks (Topicwise & Toughness Ladder)

1. Made Easy Workbook – Computer Networks (Topicwise GATE Questions)
🔹 Contains 20+ years of topic-wise GATE problems
🔹 Solve once with full focus → tag unsolved/hard ones for revision


2. GO PDF: Must-Solve CN Questions (with concepts)
🔹 Curated questions from GO + GATE + TIFR + ISRO
🔹 Contains traps, formula edge cases

🔍 Revision Strategy

Make a “1-page per topic” CN journal → Layered with:

Protocol name

Layers involved

Service provided

Key formulas (throughput, delay, etc.)

Traps (e.g., stop-and-wait vs go-back-N)
