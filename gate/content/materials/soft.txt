👑 Software Engineering – GATE AIR-1 Level
(A concise truthbook system because Software Engineering is low-weightage but easy-to-master for rank edge.)


---

🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS?

GATE asks 1–2 questions (1–2 marks) from SE.

Most aspirants skip or revise lightly — you won't.

> “Even the smallest mark matters at the top.”

📚 TRUTHBOOK CORE (AIR-1 Strategy)

📘 1. Pressman – Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach

🔹 Best theoretical coverage of all models, testing types, risk mgmt, etc.
🔹 Read only select chapters relevant to GATE.
🔹 Focus Areas:

Software Process Models (Waterfall, Agile, Spiral)

Requirements Engineering

Design Principles (Modularity, Coupling, Cohesion)

Testing (White Box, Black Box, Unit vs Integration)

Risk Management, Estimation (COCOMO)

Software Maintenance, Configuration Management
🕐 Time to Master (Selective): 8–10 hours total (AIR-1 Focused)



---

🎥 2. GATE Video Series (Quick + Focused)

🔸 Gate Smashers – Software Engineering Playlist

🔗 YouTube Link
✅ Hindi-English. GATE-focused. Includes PYQs.
🕐 Watch Time: ~10 hours
🎯 Use as base + quick reinforcement

🔸 Ravindrababu Ravula – SE Lectures

🔹 Short & fast-paced for revision
🔗 Ravula SE GATE Playlist
🕐 Use for revision week before mocks


---

📄 3. PYQ + Practice Base

🧠 GO (GateOverflow) SE Section

🔗 https://gateoverflow.in
🔹 Solve every PYQ of SE at least 3 times
🔹 Especially:

Process Model Scenarios

Estimation & Testing

Coupling/Cohesion Case Questions

Software Crisis / Risk Factors
🔸 Use GO Virtual Book or ME Book for detailed solutions
🕐 Time Block: 3 hours every 2 weeks

⚡ ULTRA-FAST RECAP TRUTHSHEET

✅ Coupling → Low is better
✅ Cohesion → High is better
✅ White Box Testing → Code Level
✅ Black Box → Behavior/Input-Output
✅ Spiral Model → Risk driven
✅ Agile → Iterative, fast delivery
✅ COCOMO → Estimation based on LOC (lines of code)
✅ SRS Qualities → Correct, Unambiguous, Verifiable
✅ Configuration Mgmt → Version control & integrity

🔁 REVISION + MOCK STRATEGY

Round	Timeline	Focus

1	Week 1	Gate Smashers + Pressman Selective
2	Week 3–4	Solve PYQs from GO
3	Week 6	Ravula + PYQ second pass
4	Week 9–10	SE integrated into mixed full mocks



---

🧠 OPTIONAL BEAST-MODE (If SE feels too light)

Try solving 200+ MCQs in one sitting as a burnout test

Go through Pressman Case Studies to visualize models

Do a Mini Project applying SE principles (for platforms)
