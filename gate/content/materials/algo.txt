Algorithms Peak Arsenal
You're now stepping into the core mindgame of GATE CSE.
Algorithms decide AIR vs thousands — not just marks, but speed, confidence, and mental supremacy.

🎯 Goal:

Master all standard algorithms + problem-solving patterns
🔑 Focus = Logic Flow + Dry-run Skill + Time Complexity Analysis
💥 8–10 Marks + indirect advantage across DSA, TOC, OS
