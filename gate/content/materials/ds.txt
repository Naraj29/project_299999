Data Structures Peak Arsenal 
You’re entering the heart of CS now.
DS is where AIR 1s build speed, accuracy, and mental control over the paper.

---

🎯 Goal:

10–12 Marks potential. Time-saver in GATE if mastered.
🔑 Focus = Concepts + Dry-run Clarity + GATE-specific Implementation


---

📚 Main Resources

✅ 1. Core Book

📘 Book: Fundamentals of Data Structures in C – Horowitz & Sahni

Covers GATE-style concepts deeply (Non-coding perspective)

Prefer over local guidebooks for theory clarity




---

✅ 2. YouTube Lectures

🎥 Neso Academy (DSA Playlist) – Clear fundamentals + visuals

🎥 CodeHelp by Love Babbar – Interview + GATE blend

🎥 Take U Forward – Playlist

Great for visualization and memory building




---

✅ 3. C++/C Implementation (if you do coding too)

📘 Book (optional): DSA Made Easy by Narasimha Karumanchi (Only for implementation-type GATE questions)

Platform Practice:

🔗 Leetcode (for Trees, Linked List, Stack)

🔗 GeeksforGeeks GATE Topic-wise DS

🔗 GATE Overflow – Data Structure PYQs
