🔁 Revision Strategy

📜 Round 1:

K-Map practice (minimize 10 expressions by hand)

Truth tables for all gates, MUX, FFs


📜 Round 2:

Draw and memorize state transitions

Solve previous 10-year GATE Digital Logic questions


📜 Round 3:

Rapid-fire MCQs (timed)

Make formula flashcards:

FF characteristic tables, conversion formulas, SOP/POS formats
