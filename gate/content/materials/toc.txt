👑 Theory of Computation (TOC)
(A precision strike for AIR-1, not just qualification. TOC is concept-heavy, mistake-sensitive, and high scoring.)

🧠 WHY TOC MATTERS?

8–10 marks consistently in GATE

100% conceptual — no rote, no guesswork

One silly mistake → multiple marks gone.
You must become a TOC warrior, not just a learner.

🧩 TOPIC-WISE BREAKDOWN (AIR-1 Focus Style)

🔢 Topic	🎯 Weight	⚠️ Focus Area

Finite Automata (DFA/NFA)	High	DFA construction, NFA→DFA, DFA minimization
Regular Expressions & RG	High	RE↔FA, Arden’s theorem, Closure Properties
Pumping Lemma (Regular)	Medium	Applying lemma properly, counter-example logic
CFG & PDA	High	CFG generation, Ambiguity, PDA from CFG
Pumping Lemma (CFL)	Medium	Trickier than regular, needs intuition
Turing Machines	High	TM design, Halting problem, Unsolvability
Decidability & Undecidability	Very High	Recursive, RE, Rice’s Theorem, Reductions
Closure Properties	Medium	Union, Intersection, Complement for Reg/CFL/TM

📄 3. PYQs and Practice Base

🧠 GateOverflow TOC Section

🔗 https://gateoverflow.in
✅ Best solutions online | Follow explanations from experts
✅ Sort by topic (FA, PDA, TM etc.)
✅ Revise each PYQ 3 times before exam
✅ Solve mixed topic mock problems


---

📌 MASTER SHEET: TOC CONCEPT SNAPSHOTS

✅ DFA ↔ Regex ↔ NFA ↔ ε-NFA ↔ RG (all equivalent)
✅ Min. DFA → Use Myhill-Nerode / table filling
✅ Regular languages NOT closed under infinite union
✅ Pumping Lemma = proof of non-regularity
✅ PDA ≠ DPDA → Ambiguity detection
✅ TM → Recognizer, not always decider
✅ Rice’s Theorem: All non-trivial semantic properties of TM undecidable
✅ Decidable ⊂ RE ⊂ R

🔁 REVISION STRATEGY

Round	Time	Task

1	Week 1–2	Gate Smashers full + Linz first 3 ch.
2	Week 3–4	CFG, PDA, TMs + start PYQs (GO)
3	Week 6	Ravula fast review + solve again
4	Week 8–10	Practice difficult TM + Rice’s Thm
5	Before mocks	Full mixed practice (PYQs + GO mocks)

⚡ BEAST-MODE BOOSTERS (Optional but AIR-1 Edge)

Try designing all automata & TM by hand

Write your own Pumping Lemma counterexamples

Build a “TOC mistakes logbook” of traps you fall for

Create flashcards for Closure Properties & Class Relations

Explain Rice’s theorem to an imaginary student (or mirror)
